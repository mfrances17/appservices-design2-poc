# Keycloak X - Continuous Delivery

* **Status**: Notes
* **JIRA**: TBD

Keycloak server upgrades should be seamless, including zero downtime. It should be very little effort to keep up to
date with the latest Keycloak releases.

Server level configuration changes should be easy to try out in dev, before deploying to production, but of course
taking a detour via a test environment.

It should also be possible to easily reproduce realm level configuration between dev, test and production environments.

The details around this is, well TBD ;)
