# Admin Console UI Screens

* **Status**: Draft #1
* **JIRA**: [KEYCLOAK-9012](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-9012)

## Motivation

The admin console is on its way to a new version, which will adopt a brand new look and feel. The user experience will also be greatly improved. This process now proceeds to the design phase.

For ease of reference, all the proposed design links will be kept in this document.
